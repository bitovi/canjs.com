@body

## Use

By default, the [Bower plugin](https://github.com/bitovi/system-bower) will only load configurations for deps listed in `dependencies`. In some cases you might want to also load the `devDependencies`, for example when running unit tests. to do so just include `bowerDev` in the script tag when loading Steal:

    <script src="bower_components/steal/steal.js"
	  data-bower-dev="true"
	  data-main="tests"></script>

## Implementation

Implemented in [system-bower](https://github.com/bitovi/system-bower).
