There's much to accomplish for CanJS 2.2 ... too much! We want to build what's 
most important to you, our community.  So on `Sept 9th at 6 PM CST` over 
[join.me](https://join.me/279-673-700) or 
at [CanJS Chicago](http://www.meetup.com/CanJS-Chicago/events/169891572/),
we will collectively "buy" (with [Bithub](http://bithub.com) points) 
some of the features listed in github.

Each feature has a price in Bithub points. 

Everyone attending the sale in person or online will get 5 points plus 
their [Bithub points](http://bithub.com/leaderboard) towards purchasing features.  

There's only enough points to buy about half the features, 
so you will have to pool your money to get what you want.

You can lower the price by upvoting the issue on [Bithub](http://bithub.com/canjs/feature?state=open).

If you'd like to participate, please [email me](mailto:justin@bitovi.com) prior to the event, so
I can prepare 
your [points](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174wFz-tLBzSL77Z0pUlCXxvL2g9uRwvaLJXGqCbZFYg/edit?usp=sharing).
_Everyone_ is welcome to participate.

## Event Agenda

Our hope that this will create a lot of discussion around what 
features are important to which people.  

The following is the event plan:

 - `6:00 PM CST` - I will go over each feature and what it means.  Questions can be asked over IRC.
 - `7:00 PM CST` - Floor will be open for 10 minutes for people to try to convince people to purchase their favorite features.
 - `7:00 PM CST` - Once all features have been explained, we 
   will cycle through each participant. 
   - The participant will put all their points behind a feature.
   - If the purchase amount is matched, the feature is purchased. 
     Everyone who put points behind that feature is done playing 
     the game.
   - If the purchase amount is not matched, the participant 
     will have one minute to try to convince people to 
     put their money in the same feature.
   - Once all participants have played, the first round 
     is complete.  
   - Before the second round, the floor will be opened 
     again for 10 minutes.  Participants should try to 
     negotiate for the features they want. 
   - We will continue with additional round until all 
     money is used up or a stalemate.
