We're excited to announce our official migration to Stack Overflow for CanJS Question and Answer support. With CanJS developers already active on Stack Overflow, it's one of the best places to recieve direct support for technical questions.

As [mentioned on the forums previously](https://forum.javascriptmvc.com/#Topic/32525000001733053), the forums will still be used for discussions and ideas. However, to make sure the CanJS team can effectively answer questions on Stack Overflow, the "Questions" area of the forums will be made read-only.

### Getting Started

To get started, either use the "Questions" link on CanJS.com or [check out the CanJS tag on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/canjs).

![Search by Tag](/img/blog/stackoverflow/search-by-tag.png)

To ask a question, simply click "Ask a Question" (and make sure to use the CanJS tag). Check out [this forum post](https://forum.javascriptmvc.com/#Topic/32525000001733053) or Stack Overflow's [help pages](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) for some advice on asking good questions.

When you participate on Stack Overflow, you build reputation. Increased reputation results in more privileges on Stack Overflow. For more information, check out the [Stack Overflow Tour](http://stackoverflow.com/tour).

### Weekly stats

As part of our effort to ensure quality support for the CanJS developer community, each week we'll report the number of CanJS questions and answers on Stack Overflow via the [CanJS Twitter](http://twitter.com/canjs).
