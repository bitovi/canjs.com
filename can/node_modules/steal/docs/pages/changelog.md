## 0.11.0

### steal

- css and less extensions moved to their own projects [steal-css](https://github.com/stealjs/steal-css) and [steal-less](https://github.com/stealjs/steal-less).
- Babel and Traceur updated to the latest versions.
- [envs configuration](https://github.com/stealjs/steal/issues/454).
- The [@loader](https://github.com/stealjs/steal/pull/460) module not works with the Steal syntax.
- Whether bundles are loaded is not configured by [System.loadBundles], not the `env` flag, but env=production still works for backworks compatibility.
- The [@steal] module was created to serve a similar purpose as [@loader].

### steal-tools

- `sideBundle: true` metadata property can be set to make a bundle be set as a "sideBundle". A sideBundle is not considered in the progressive loading algorithm so it is perfect for bundles that are rarely used.
- Globals are no longer transpiled to a `System.define` form, but instead to an AMD module.
- Virtual modules (modules created dynamically with `System.define` can now be [bundles](https://github.com/stealjs/steal-tools/pull/276) themselves.
- [steal-tools.BundleAssetsOptions bundleAssets] is a new option that allows you to bundle all of your assets along with your JavaScript and CSS bundles, to put everything into a common `dist` folder.
- StealTools is now tested in CI on Node 0.10, 0.12, and IO.js, on both Linux and Windows.

## 0.10.0

### steal

- New [live-reload](http://stealjs.com/docs/steal.live-reload.html) extension.
- Added a [steal.import](http://stealjs.com/docs/steal.import.html) to make it easier to work in Node. [#407](https://github.com/stealjs/steal/issues/407).

### steal-tools

- Added a [new command](http://stealjs.com/docs/steal-tools.cmd.live-reload.html) for the cli, `steal-tools live-reload` which starts a server for use with the live-reload workflow. [#223](https://github.com/stealjs/steal-tools/pull/233).

## 0.9.0

### steal

- The npm plugin added a `configDependencies` option. [#55](https://github.com/stealjs/system-npm/pull/55).
- Steal can be launched within a web worker. [#386](https://github.com/stealjs/steal/issues/386).
- The bower plugin can take a `system.main` that mirrors npm's behavior. [#16](https://github.com/stealjs/system-bower/pull/16).
- The bower plugin supports `system.bowerIgnore` for ignoring modules. [#17](https://github.com/stealjs/system-bower/pull/17).
- You can now pass your own paths to `lessOptions`. [#378](https://github.com/stealjs/steal/pull/378).

### steal-tools

## 0.8.0

- StealTools now produces source maps for both multi-build and export. [#210](https://github.com/stealjs/steal-tools/pull/210). Check out the [build docs](http://stealjs.com/docs/steal-tools.build.html) for example usage.
- The cli is now easier to use. The `package.json` is now the default config, so no `--config` or `--main` option is needed if using the npm plugin. [#212](https://github.com/stealjs/steal-tools/pull/212)
- Upgraded SystemJS to `0.16.6`, ES6 Module Loader to `0.16.3` and Traceur to `0.0.87`.

- Updated SystemJS and ESML.
- Choice of ES6 compiler can be controlled through the [System.transpiler transpiler] config.
- [System.bundle] can now take a glob.
- Loading in Node on Windows no longer requires setting paths with `file:` prefix.
- Less plugin upgraded to use Less 2.4.0.

### steal-tools

- Bundles now get written to subdirectories of [System.bundlesPath bundlesPath] to ensure unique. [#52](https://github.com/bitovi/steal-tools/pull/54)
- All tests passing on Windows.
- `main` and `bundle` names can be the unnormalized. [#89](https://github.com/bitovi/steal-tools/issues/89).

      });

### steal

- Replaced `@config` with [System.configMain]. If you were doing:
