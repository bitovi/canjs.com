CanJS is designed to be a very well-rounded JavaScript framework, useful to almost any client-side JavaScript
team. 

It provides a wealth of JavaScript utilities that combine to make testable and repeatable Model-View-ViewModel
applications with very little code.  

CanJS provides the default MV\* libraries to the [DoneJS](http://donejs.com) framework.  Checkout DoneJS's [quick
start guide](http://donejs.com/Guide.html) for an example of using CanJS to build a server-side rendered, real-time
chat app that works as an Android, iOS, and Desktop app. 

<h2 id="Flexible">Flexible</h2>

CanJS is __flexible__. Unlike other frameworks, it's designed to work in almost any situation. 
You can readily use third party plugins,
modify the DOM with jQuery directly, and even use alternate DOM libraries like Zepto and Dojo. 
CanJS supports all browsers, including IE8.

<h2 id="Powerful">Powerful</h2>

CanJS is __powerful__. Create [custom elements](../docs/can.Component.html) with 
[one and two-way bindings](/docs/can.view.bindings.html). 
Easily [define](../docs/can.Map.prototype.define.html) the behavior of 
observable objects and their derived values. Avoid memory 
leaks with smart model stores and smart event binding.  

<h2 id="Fast">Fast</h2>

CanJS is __fast__. It is only about 20k. Its live-binding updates only what needs to be updated without requiring a
"diff".  


<h2 id="Friendly">Friendly</h2>

CanJS is __friendly__.  Our [fulltime](http://donejs.com/About.html#section=section_Fulltimeteam) and 
[core](http://donejs.com/About.html#section=section_Coreteam) team are extremely active on 
[gitter chat](https://gitter.im/canjs/canjs) and on the [forums](http://forums.donejs.com/c/canjs) and
