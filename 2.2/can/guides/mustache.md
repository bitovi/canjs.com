[Mustache](../docs/can.mustache.html) is a logic-less templating languages
[which provide live binding when used with Observes. CanJS's Mustache
implementation supports both [normal Mustache templates](http://mustache.github.io/) 
as well as the Handlebars extensions, allowing you to easily reuse
templates that you've already written.

Mustache templates are essentially straight HTML, except that they contain
special tags used for injecting your data into the HTML. The number of ways
you can inject data is limited by design for simplicity and maintainability,
but can be enhanced through the use of helpers.

Here's an example of a template that might render a list of Todos:

```
<script type="text/mustache" id="todosList">
{{#todos}}
<li>{{description}}</li>
{{/todos}}
</script>
```

You can use `can.view` to render the template:

```
Todo.findAll({}, function(todos) {
	document.getElementById('list')
		.appendChild(can.view('todoList', {todos: todos}));
});
```

## Magic tags

There are three kinds of magic tags used in Mustache:

- `{{ }}` will HTML-escape the value enclosed inside the tags and write it to
the template.
- `{{{ }}}` will write the value enclosed inside the tags directly
to the template without escaping it.
- `{{! }}` is a comment that writes nothing to the template.

### Variables

Variable tags insert data into the template. They reference variables in the current
context.

This template:

```
Name: {{name}}
```

given this data:

```
{name: 'Alice'}
```

will render the following:

```
Name: Alice
```

### Sections

Sections contain text blocks and are conditionally rendered based on the
variable enclosed in the opening tag. They also change the active context
inside them to that of the variable referenced in the opening tag.

For the following examples, we will assume the template is being populated with
this set of data:

```
{
	name: 'Alice Liddell',
	nickname: '',
	friends: ['Bob', 'Eve'],
	enemies: []
}
```

If the variable is `undefined`, `null`, `false`, `''`, or `[]`, it is considered
a falsey value and the section is not rendered at all. Neither of these sections
will render:

```
{{#enemies}}
<li>{{.}}</li>
{{/enemies}}
```

```
{{#nickname}}{{.}}{{/nickname}}
```

If the variable is a non-empty array, the section will be rendered once for each
element in the array. If it is truthy but not an array, the section is rendered
once.

This template:

```
<h1>{{#name}}{{.}}{{/name}}</h1>
<ul>
	{{#friends}}
	<li>{{.}}</li>
	{{/friends}}
</ul>
```

will render like this:

```
<h1>Alice Liddell</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Bob</li>
	<li>Eve</li>
</ul>
```

You can also make inverted sections that render if the variable referenced in the
opening tag is falsey:

```
<ul>
	{{#friends}}
	<li>{{.}}</li>
	{{/friends}}
	{{^friends}}
	<li>You have no friends.</li>
	{{/friends}}
</ul>
```

### Context

When Mustache is resolving an object in a section, it sets the current context
to the object value for which it is iterating. (If the variable in the opening tag
of a section was not an array, it sets the context to the value of that variable.)
You can reference the current context as `.`.

Internally, Mustache keeps a stack of contexts as the template enters nested
sections and helpers. If a variable is not found in the current context, Mustache
will look for the the in each successive parent context until it resolves the
variable or runs out of parent contexts.

For example, with this data:

```
{
	brothers: [{name: 'Bob'}, {name: 'David'}],
	sisters: [{name: 'Alice'}, {name: 'Eve'}]
}
```

and this template:

```
{{#brothers}}
	{{#sisters}}
		{{name}}
	{{/sisters}}
{{/brothers}}
```

the rendered result will be:

```
Alice
Eve
Alice
Eve
```

Since there is no `sisters` variable in the context of the elements of the `brothers`
array, Mustache jumps up to the parent context and resolves `sisters` there.

## Helpers

Mustache lets you register functions to be called from inside the template
called helpers. Since Mustache templates are logic-less, all of your view
logic will either be manipulated outside of the template or it will be inside
a helper.

To use a helper that is local to the template you're rendering, pass it as the
third argument to `can.view` in an object where the key is the name of the helper
and the value is the helper function:

```
var fragment = can.view('todosList', {todos: todos}, {
	uppercase: function(str) {
		return str.toUppercase();
	}
});
```

This might be used in a template like this:

```
<script type="text/mustache" id="todosList">
{{#todos}}
<li>{{uppercase description}}</li>
{{/todos}}
</script>
```

If a property of an observe is passed to a helper function, the helper will
become a [can.compute](../docs/can.compute.html). As an example, if you had this template:

```
<script type="text/mustache" id="prefixedName">
<div>{{addMs lastName}}</div>
</script>
```

And you ran this code:

```
var name = new can.Observe({firstName: 'Alice', lastName: 'Liddell'});
document.getElementById('name')
	.appendChild(can.view('prefixedName', name, {
		addMs: function(lastName) {
			return 'Ms. ' + lastName;
		}
	}));
name.attr({firstName: 'Allison', lastName: 'Wonderland'});
```

The contents of the <div> would be `Ms. Wonderland`.

### Global helpers

You can register global helpers using [can.mustache.registerHelper](../docs/can.mustache.registerHelper.html):

```
can.mustache.registerHelper('i10n', function(str, options) {
	return (Globalize != undefined ? Globalize.localize(str) : str);
});
```

### Data helpers

You can use the `data` helper in Mustache to associate data to an element. This
helper will associate the current context (`.`) with a variable you pass to the
helper.

For example, this template:

```
<script type="text/mustache" id="nameDiv">
<div id="person" {{data 'name'}}>{{firstName}} {{lastName}}</div>
</script>
```

lets you do this in code:

```
document.body.appendChild(can.view('nameDiv', {
	firstName: 'Alice',
	lastName: 'Liddell'
}));

var obj = can.data(document.getElementById('person'), 'name');
obj; // { firstName: 'Alice', lastName: 'Liddell'}
```

## Partials

You can nest templates in other templates by using partials. Partials inherit
the context from which they are called. They are evaluated at render time, so you
should be careful to avoid infinite loops. To include a partial, put its URL or
ID inside `{{> }}`.

With these templates:
```
<script type="text/mustache" id="names">
<ul>
{{#names}}
	{{>user}}
{{/names}}
</ul>
</script>
<script type="text/mustache" id="user">
<li>{{firstName}} {{lastName}}</li>
</script>
```

the expanded template at render time would look similar to:

```
<ul>
{{#names}}
	<li>{{firstName}} {{lastName}}</li>
{{/names}}
</ul>
```
